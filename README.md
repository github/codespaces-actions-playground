# GitHub Actions Playground

Welcome to the GitHub Actions Playground! We've got everything fired up and running for you to explore GitHub Actions.

Everything you do here is contained within this one codespace. There is no repository on GitHub yet. As part of this exercise we'll prompt you to publish a repository to help you see workflows in action. If you were just exploring and haven't published to a repository, you can simply delete your codespace and any related changes made in that codespace will be gone forever.

## Instructions for using the Playground

If you have forked this repository and would like to use this as a codespace template:

1. Visit `https://github.com/<organization>/<repository>/settings`
2. Check the box next to General > Template repository
3. Visit `https://github.com/<organization>/<repository>`
4. Click "Use this template" button at the top right
5. Click "Open in a codespace"

If you need to delete the codespace, you can do this at [https://github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces)
